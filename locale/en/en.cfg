[mod-setting-description]
PDA-setting-tech-required=Uncheck this if you want drive assistant and cruise control to work without researching the technology at first.
PDA-setting-allow-cruise-control=This parameter determines if any player is allowed to use cruise control. If you experience significant lags, unchecking this might save you approximately 20% of the overall load created by this mod.
PDA-setting-tick-rate=This parameter determines the amount of ticks for one driving assistant scan (i.e. if set to "2" there are 30 scans per second).\n\nSet this value to 1 if you want maximum precision (causing additional load).\nSet this to "3" or greater to reduce the load on your CPU, at the cost of decreased precision. \nPlease keep in mind, that setting this to very high values will make the driving assistant increasingly sluggish and finally useless at higher speeds!
PDA-setting-assist-min-speed=Minimum speed to start assisting in.
PDA-setting-assist-high-speed=If a vehicle is faster than the given speed, the scanned area in front of the vehicle will be linearily increased.
PDA-setting-game-max-speed=Use this parameter to set up a mandatory speed limit for all players and all rideable "car"-type entities (so trains will not be affected) in your game. This will also limit the maximum load caused by this mod, as higher speeds are generally more demanding in terms of CPU time.\n\nSet this value to "0" for unlimited speed.
PDA-setting-verbose=If checked, PDA will announce state changes of the driving assistant/cruise control (i.e. "activated"/"deactivated") to the console.
PDA-setting-sound-alert=As long as this is checked, a short warning sound will be played when the player's vehicle has left paved ground (indicating a dead end or an unintended failure of the PDA). If unchecked, the warning will be printed to console instead.
PDA-setting-score=Use this parameter to customize your road tile priority. On default, asphalt tiles will be prioritized over concrete ones and those again over stone path tiles. The driving assistant will try to steer your vehicle onto the tile with highest score (i.e. if you use stone as your road tile within an concreted base, set "Stone > Concrete". \nAsphalt values will be only considered if mods providing such tiles are present.
PDA-setting-alt-toggle-mode=Checking this option will alter the behaviour of the primary control key for cruise control ("__CONTROL__toggle_cruise_control__"). Instead of setting the value to the current vehicle speed, it will just use the last used value. To set or change the value, you'll then need to press "__CONTROL__set_cruise_control_limit__".
PDA-setting-score-switch-concrete-and-stone=If checked, the driving assistant will prioritise stone path tiles over concrete tiles. This is useful if your base is mostly covered with concrete and you therefore use roads made of stone.
